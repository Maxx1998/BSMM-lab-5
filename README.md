# BSMM-lab-5

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starter materials for BSMM-8740 lab-5. See the course website for lab instructions.

Before you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo (i.e. save, stage, commit and push).

Remember -- you do **not** have to turn in an \*.html file. I will be pulling your work directly from your repository on the [course github site](https://github.com/BSMM-8740-Fall-2023).
